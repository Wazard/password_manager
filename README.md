# 🛡️ Secure Vault

A lightweight, cross-platform password manager built with Python and CustomTkinter. Secure Vault features a high-performance AES-encrypted storage system and a unique "decryption-style" animated password generator.

## ✨ Features

* **AES Encryption**: All data is secured using industry-standard AES encryption before being saved to disk.
* **Multi-Language Support**: Fully localized in English, Italian, French, Spanish, and Danish.
* **Animated Generator**: A "hacking-style" password generator that jumbles and locks characters for a professional UI experience.
* **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Your master password is never stored; data can only be decrypted locally on your machine.
* **Modern UI**: Built with a sleek, dark-themed interface designed for high scannability.
